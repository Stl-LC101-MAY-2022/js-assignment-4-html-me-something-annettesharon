         <p><span>From being named a top public university to being known as America's Healthiest Campus, OSU's awards and rankings showcase our academic distinctions, campus culture and value. As of 2021, Oklahoma State students and alumni have won 34 Olympic medals (21 gold, 5 silver, and 8 bronze). OSU has the nation's largest student union, which has continued to serve students, alumni, and the Stillwater community for over 65 years. Offering expansive dining and retail options as well as meeting and event space, it is the heart of the OSU Campus. It was built without a single cent from the taxpayers. </span></p>
