         <p><span>From being named a top public university to being known as America's Healthiest Campus, OSU's awards and rankings showcase our academic distinctions, campus culture and value.

Notable buildings at OSU include Old Central, OSU's first permanent academic building; the Boone Pickens Stadium; the Gallagher-Iba Arena; and the Student Union. Located within the Gallagher-Iba Arena is OSU's Heritage Hall, a museum displaying the history of Oklahoma State University Athletics. Guests are welcome to browse the many displays of memorabilia from the college's beginning in 1890 to today. Items include trophies, athletic uniforms, ticket stubs, photos and more.</span></p>
